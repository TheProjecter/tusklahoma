I am currently following programming lessons posted over at http://www.reddit.com/r/carlhprogramming and have found them to be excellent sources of information. The code I post here will be influenced by what I have learned from the lessons so far and from problems / solutions provided by other people reading the lessons. If you are looking to begin learning, or just learn / brush up in general, about computer programming and have been looking for tutorials / guides / etc, then I highly recommend checking out CarlH's lessons.

Feel free to critique my code, it could always be improved upon and that is exactly what I want to accomplish. To improve my skills and increase my knowledge of the subject. Cheers.
